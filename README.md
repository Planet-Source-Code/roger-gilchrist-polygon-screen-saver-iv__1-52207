### Description

Added a few new properties and tightened up the code.

Inspired by 'Bouncing Polygon screensaver' by Brian Adriance at txtCodeId=52063.

Converted to allow more variety of shapes. Collision detection and all basic ideas are thanks to Brian Adriance. I rebuilt some of his routines to allow faster or more various values to be used easily. Sub DrawPoly is mine designed to allow a random number of points to be drawn. The polygons change shape in an orderly way cycling for min to max points then reversing direction. While you can use it as a screen saver (with random setting of number, speed, points and fatness) you can also experiment with the appearance by Left-clicking on the screen to show a form which allows you to play with the settings or by Right-clicking you can randomize the settings again. To stop the screensaver hold down a mouse button and drag it or press any key. NOTE Small bug causes initial bad redraws when timer fires but the clear up on next collision.
